📅 Life Calendar is the perfect app to help you visualize your life in a unique way. Inspired by Tim Urban's legendary Ted Talk on procrastination, our app creates a simple wallpaper generator that uses your date of birth to create an image with 960 boxes (12 months X 80 years). Each box represents a month of your life, with filled boxes representing the months you have already lived, and empty boxes representing the months you have yet to experience. 🌟

📱 With Life Calendar, you can easily set the generated image as your mobile wallpaper with just a tap of a button. Plus, a copy of the image is saved to your device, so you can use it anywhere you like. 🖼️
